## zgen

A lightweight plugin manager for Zsh inspired by [Antigen](https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen). Keep your `.zshrc` clean and simple.

Zgen provides you a few simple commands for managing plugins. It installs your plugins and generates a static init script that will source them for you every time you run the shell. We do this to save some startup time by not having to execute time consuming logic (plugin checking, updates, etc). This means that you have to manually check for updates (`zgen update`) and reset the init script (`zgen reset`) whenever you add or remove plugins.

The motive for creating zgen was to have plugins quickly installed on a new machine without getting the startup lag that Antigen used to give me.

## Installation

Clone the zgen repository

```zsh
git clone https://github.com/tarjoilija/zgen.git "${HOME}/.zgen"
```

Edit your `.zshrc` file to load zgen

```zsh
# load zgen
source "${HOME}/.zgen/zgen.zsh"
```

Place the following code after the one above to load oh-my-zsh for example, see Usage for more details

```zsh
# if the init script doesn't exist
if ! zgen saved; then

    # specify plugins here
    zgen oh-my-zsh

    # generate the init script from plugins above
    zgen save
fi
```

## Usage

### oh-my-zsh

This is a handy shortcut for installing oh-my-zsh plugins. They can be loaded using `zgen load` too with a significantly longer format.

#### Load oh-my-zsh base

It's a good idea to load the base components before specifying any plugins.

```zsh
zgen oh-my-zsh
```

#### Load oh-my-zsh plugins

```zsh
zgen oh-my-zsh <location>
```

#### Example

```zsh
zgen oh-my-zsh
zgen oh-my-zsh plugins/git
zgen oh-my-zsh plugins/sudo
zgen oh-my-zsh plugins/command-not-found
zgen oh-my-zsh themes/arrow
```

### Prezto

#### Load Prezto

```zsh
zgen prezto
```

This will create a symlink in the `ZSHDOT` or `HOME` directory. This is needed by prezto.

#### Load prezto plugins

```zsh
zgen prezto <modulename>
```

This uses the Prezto method for loading modules.

#### Load a repo as Prezto plugins

```zsh
zgen pmodule <reponame> <branch>
```

This uses the Prezto method for loading the module. It creates a symlink and calls `pmodule`.

#### Set prezto options

```zsh
zgen prezto <modulename> <option> <value(s)>
```

This must be used before the module is loaded. Or if the default modules should be loaded (default) these settings must be done before the `zgen prezto` command. `module` is prepended if the name does not start with `module`, `prezto` or a `*`, `prezto` is prepended if it does not start with `prezto`.

### General zgen functions

#### Load plugins and completions

```zsh
zgen load <repo> [location] [branch]
```

Zgen tries to source any scripts from `location` using a "very smart matching logic". If it fails to find any, it will appends `location` to `$fpath`.

- `repo`
  - github `user/repository` or path to a repository
  - currently supported formats for a repository path:
    - any local repository
    - `git://*`
    - `https://*`
    - `http://*`
    - `ssh://*`
    - `git@*:*/*`
- `location`
  - relative path to a script/folder
  - useful for repositories that don't have proper plugin support like `zsh-users/zsh-completions`
- `branch`
  - specifies the git branch to use

#### Bulk load plugins

```zsh
zgen loadall <plugins>
```

Please see example `.zshrc` for usage.

#### Generate init script

```zsh
zgen save
```

It is recommended to save the plugin sourcing part to a static init script so we don't have to go through the time consuming installing/updating part every time we start the shell (or source .zshrc)

#### Remove init script

```zsh
zgen reset
```

Removes the init script so it will be created next time you start the shell. You must run this every time you add or remove plugins to trigger the changes.

This will not remove the plugins physically from disk.

#### Check for an init script

```zsh
zgen saved
```

Returns 0 if an init script exists.

#### Update all plugins and reset

```zsh
zgen update
```

Pulls updates on every plugin repository and removes the init script.

#### Update zgen

```zsh
zgen selfupdate
```

#### Watch files for modifications

You can automate the process of running `zgen reset` by specifying a list of files to `ZGEN_RESET_ON_CHANGE`. These files will be checked and if a change is detected zgen reset is called.

```zsh
ZGEN_RESET_ON_CHANGE=(${HOME}/.zshrc ${HOME}/.zshrc.local)
```

## Notes

Be aware that `zgen` tries to handle [`compinit`][compinit] for you to allow for the fastest possible initialization times. However, this functionality will be disabled if you've already called `compinit` yourself before sourcing `zgen.zsh`. Alternatively, you can disable it yourself by disabling `$ZGEN_AUTOLOAD_COMPINIT`.

[compinit]: http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/Completion-System.html#Use-of-compinit "Zsh manual 20.2.1: Use of compinit"

## Example .zshrc

```zsh
# load zgen
source "${HOME}/.zgen/zgen.zsh"

# if the init scipt doesn't exist
if ! zgen saved; then
    echo "Creating a zgen save"

    zgen oh-my-zsh

    # plugins
    zgen oh-my-zsh plugins/git
    zgen oh-my-zsh plugins/sudo
    zgen oh-my-zsh plugins/command-not-found
    zgen load zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting
    zgen load /path/to/super-secret-private-plugin

    # bulk load
    zgen loadall <<EOPLUGINS
        zsh-users/zsh-history-substring-search
        /path/to/local/plugin
EOPLUGINS
    # ^ can't indent this EOPLUGINS

    # completions
    zgen load zsh-users/zsh-completions src

    # theme
    zgen oh-my-zsh themes/arrow

    # save all to init script
    zgen save
fi
```

### Example .zshrc for prezto use

Here is a partial example how to work with prezto

```zsh
echo "Creating a zgen save"

# prezto options
zgen prezto editor key-bindings 'emacs'
zgen prezto prompt theme 'sorin'

# prezto and modules
zgen prezto
zgen prezto git
zgen prezto command-not-found
zgen prezto syntax-highlighting

# plugins
zgen load /path/to/super-secret-private-plugin
```
